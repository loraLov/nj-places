Their names are engraved into two tall silver walls that make up the memorial. When visitors walk down the granite path between the walls, it will lead them to where the World Trade Center buildings once stood across the Hudson River. Located near the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal, the memorial “remembers those lost while simply and powerfully connecting New Jersey to Ground Zero.”",
